# Air Vent 80 mm

This project contains the design files for an 80 mm air vent suitable for wall installation to allow airflow out of a room. The air vent is designed to be connected to an 80 mm aluminum duct.

## Components

1. **Louvered Cover**: This cover has angled slats to prevent rain or other debris from entering while allowing air to flow out.
2. **Duct Adapter**: This piece connects the louvered cover to the aluminum duct.
3. **Mounting Bracket**: The bracket is used to secure the vent to the wall, providing stability and ensuring a tight fit.
4. **Wall Plate**: This piece provides a clean finish and additional support for mounting the vent onto the wall.

## Assembly Instructions

1. **Prepare the Wall**: Cut a hole in the wall where you want to install the vent. Ensure the hole is slightly larger than the duct diameter.
2. **Attach the Mounting Bracket**: Secure the mounting bracket to the wall using screws and wall anchors if necessary.
3. **Connect the Duct Adapter**: Attach the duct adapter to the louvered cover, ensuring it fits snugly.
4. **Install the Vent**: Insert the assembled vent (louvered cover and duct adapter) into the hole. Secure it to the mounting bracket.
5. **Connect the Duct**: Attach the 80 mm aluminum duct to the duct adapter, ensuring a tight and secure fit.
6. **Finish with the Wall Plate**: Place the wall plate around the vent for a clean, finished look. Secure it with screws.

## Usage

The air vent allows for efficient ventilation, ideal for rooms requiring air circulation, such as kitchens, bathrooms, or workshops. The design ensures that the vent remains functional while preventing unwanted elements from entering the room.
